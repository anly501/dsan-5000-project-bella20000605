This could indicate that anxiety and depression are more common mental health concerns in the population.\n \nThe prevalence rates for disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders and anxiety disorders keep increaseing over the years, while the depression retes does not have a liner increasement.it has a peak in 1997 and then decrease to a lower level.\n\n#### The Bar plot\n\nTo compare the prevalence of different disorders across different income groups.\n\n#### The Box Plot\n\nBox Plot: Distribution of mental health disorders prevalence rates across different income groups in 2017.\n\nThe plot provides insights into the median prevalence rates, the interquartile ranges, and any potential outliers within each income group category.\n\nThe Box Plot above shows the distribution of 'Bipolar disorder (%)', 'Schizophrenia (%)', 'Eating disorders (%)', 'Anxiety disorders (%)'prevalence vary by income group level, while the Depression doesn't vary by income group level. \n\n\n#### Scatter plot:\n\n##### Relationship between 'average learning adjusted years of school' and mental health disorders prevalence rates\n\nSchizophrenia: There appears to be a cluster of points towards the lower end of the educational scale with varying prevalence rates. As education levels increase, the prevalence rates seem to spread out, indicating a less clear relationship.\n\nEating Disorders: This plot shows a less clear relationship. Suggesting that when education levels increase, The prevalence rates seem to spread out.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The data points are dispersed across the educational spectrum with no clear trend indicating a strong relationship between education and the prevalence of bipolar disorder.  \n\nAnxiety Disorders: There's a wide spread of prevalence rates at all levels of education, suggesting that the relationship between education and anxiety disorders may be influenced by factors other than education alone.\n\nDepression (%):  There's a wide spread of prevalence rates at all levels of education, suggesting that the relationship between education and Depression disorders may be influenced by factors other than education alone.\n\nIn general, the scatter plots show that there is no clear relationship between education and the prevalence of mental health disorders. This could indicate that other factors may be more influential in determining the prevalence of mental health disorders.\n\n##### Relationship between 'GDP(2022)' and mental health disorders prevalence rates\n\nThe scatter plots show that they does not appear to be a clear trend or correlation between GDP and the prevalence of these mental health problems.\n\nRelationship between 'GDP per capita' and mental health disorders prevalence rates.\n\nAs GDP per capita increases, the prevalence rates of eating disorder seems to spread out, while others don't show a clear trend indicating a strong relationship with gdp per capita.\n\n#### Correlation Heatmap\n\n'Income group' and 'Continent' to the list of columns for the correlation matrix, which are categorical variables. The correlation matrix typically requires numerical variables. To include these categorical variables, I convert them into a numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.\n\n<b>Socioeconomic Factors:</b> These include GDP (2022), GDP per capita, and income groups (high, low, lower middle, upper middle). High-income groups have strong positive correlations with mental health outcomes, particularly with eating disorders (0.74),  and Schizophrenia(0.58). This suggests that in high-income groups, there may be a higher reported prevalence or better diagnosis of these conditions. On the other hand, low-income groups show a moderate negative correlation with some mental health outcomes, indicating a lower reported prevalence or underdiagnosis in these groups.\n\n<b>Educational Factors:</b> The variable 'average_learning_Adjusted_of_school' shows strong positive correlations with eating disorders (0.69), and Schizophrenia(0.68). This suggests that higher education levels are associated with a higher reported prevalence of these conditions, which could be due to increased awareness and reporting in more educated populations.\n\n<b>Geographic Factors:</b> The geographic regions show varied correlations with mental health outcomes. For example, being in Africa has a strong negative correlation with schizophrenia (-0.53) and a moderate negative correlation with eating disorder (-0.39). In contrast, Europe shows a moderate positive correlation with eating disorders (0.43). These correlations suggest that geographic location can have a significant impact on the reporting and prevalence of mental health conditions, possibly due to cultural, environmental, or healthcare-related factors.\n\nIn summary, educational factors, indicated by 'average_learning_Adjusted_of_school', show the most consistent strong positive correlations across several mental health outcomes, suggesting that education level may be a strong predictor of mental health outcomes, potentially due to greater awareness and reporting. Socioeconomic factors, particularly income level, also show strong correlations, especially in high-income groups. Geographic factors show both strong negative and moderate positive correlations, indicating a more complex relationship with mental health outcomes that could be influenced by a variety of regional factors.\n\n### 2.Eating disorder Dataset\n\n#### Time Series Plot:\nShowing the trend of eating disorder prevalence over years averaged globally between male and female.\n\nThe line plot above shows the global average prevalence of eating disorders over time for males, females, and all genders combined. The trends can be compared to see how the prevalence has changed over the years. Eating disorders were more than twice as prevalent among females (3.8%) than males (1.5%)\n\n#### Grouped Bar Chart:\n\nCompare the prevalence of eating disorders between males and females across different countries. For clarity,I will take a subset of countries to compare.\n\nThe bar chart above compares the prevalence of eating disorders between males (in light blue) and females (in pink) for a randomly selected subset of 10 countries in the latest year available in the dataset.\n\n#### Box plot \n##### Identifying Outliers\n\nlooking for countries with prevalence rates that are significantly higher or lower than the global average for year 2019 for example\n\nMale Eating Disorder Prevalence Rate:\n\nThe median prevalence rate is approximately 0.11%.\nThe range of prevalence rates is quite broad, with the lowest around 0.03% and the highest at about 0.67%.\nThe interquartile range (middle 50% of the data) spans from approximately 0.08% to 0.16%, indicating that half of the reported rates fall within this range.\n\n\nFemale Eating Disorder Prevalence Rate:\n\nThe median prevalence rate is approximately 0.21%, which is notably higher than that of males.\nThe prevalence rates for females also show a broad range, from about 0.06% to 1.40%.\nThe interquartile range for females is wider than for males, ranging from about 0.14% to 0.40%, reflecting greater variability in the rates reported for females.\n\n\nOutlier Identification:\n\nFor males, any country with a prevalence rate significantly higher than 0.16% could be considered an outlier.\nFor females, countries with rates above 0.40% would be outliers, with the maximum reported rate being quite extreme at 1.40%.\n\n##### Remove the outliers\n\n#### Heatmap\n\nVisualizing the prevalence of eating disorders in US and years in a color-coded format.\n\nThe heatmap above visualizes the prevalence of eating disorders across different years in US.\n\nIn years 1993 and 2012 show the highest prevalence rates. From 2013 onwards, there appears to be a slight decrease in prevalence, with rates consistently around 0.42% to 0.43%.\n\n### 3.Age when first have depression or anxiety Data\n\n#### Pie chart\n\nShowing the distribution of age categories for the onset of anxiety or depression for the \"World\" entity,\nI'll first filter the dataset for the 'World' entity, and then plot the data.\n\nThe largest segment of the chart, making up 34.9%, is unspecified and labeled \"Don't know/Refused,\" indicating a significant portion of respondents either did not know or refused to provide their age at first experience of anxiety or depression.\n\nThe second-largest group is individuals aged 20â€“29, representing 22.2% of the distribution. This suggests that early adulthood is a common time for individuals to experience their first instance of these mental health issues.\n\nThose aged 30â€“39 make up 12.5% of the distribution, while individuals aged 40 and over account for 11.4%.\n\nAdolescents aged 13â€“19 represent 11.5% of the distribution, indicating that the onset of anxiety or depression can also begin during teenage years.\n\nThe smallest identified age group is children under the age of 13, at 7.5%, which highlights that while less common, young children can also experience these mental health issues.\n\nOverall, the data suggests that the onset of anxiety or depression is reported most frequently during the ages of 20â€“29 and that there's a notable amount of uncertainty or unwillingness to provide information regarding the age of first experience with these conditions.\n\n#### Heatmap \n\na.Visualize the relationship between entities and age groups\n\n#### Stacked bar chart\n\nGrouping the data by Entity and visualizing the distribution of the Percentage across different Age brackets.\n\nHigh Uncertainty or Non-disclosure: 'Don't know/Refused' responses are notably high across all entities, with Africa recording the highest at 42.7% ,lower-middle income countries at 40.6% and Europe the lowest at 14.5%. This indicates a significant amount of data is either not known or not disclosed.\n\nHigh-Income Countries: except for 'Don't know/Refused', The highest ratios are observed in the 'Ages 13_19'and lowest in the Age < 13\n\nUpper-middle income countries: except for 'Don't know/Refused', The ratios are more balanced across the age categories, with the lowest ratio STILL in age <13.\n\nlower-middle income countries: except for 'Don't know/Refused',The highest ratios are observed in the 'Ages 20_29' and it is almost 3 times higher than other age categories.\n\nEurope: The ratios are more balanced across the age categories, with the lowest ratio in age <13.\n\nAfrica and Asia: The ratios are Highest in the 'Ages 20_29' and lowest in the Age < 13, but the ratio in Asia is higher than Africa.\n\n## Hypothesis Generation\n\n### Age First Depression or Anxiety Data\n\n- The cultural, economic, and social environments in high-income countries might contribute to an earlier age of onset (The highest ratios are observed in the 'Ages 13_19) for anxiety or depression.\n\n- In regions with lower-middle-income levels, the onset of anxiety or depression might occur later, potentially due to different life stressors or lower levels of mental health awareness and reporting.\n\n### Eating disorder Dataset\n\n- The prevalence of eating disorders is higher in countries with higher GDP per capita, which could reflect better diagnostic capabilities or different societal pressures.\n\n- There may be significant differences in the prevalence of eating disorders between genders across different countries, potentially reflecting cultural, social, or biological factors.\n\n### Mental Health Dataset\n\n- Educational outcomes may be associated with the prevalence or reporting of certain mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia and eating disorders.\n\n- The correlations between different mental health conditions suggest the possibility of common underlying risk factors or increased comorbidity.\n\n\n\n## Report and Discuss methods and findings\n\n##### Age First Depression or Anxiety Data\n\n1. The largest segment of the chart, making up 34.9%, is unspecified and labeled \"Don't know/Refused,\" indicating a significant portion of respondents either did not know or refused to provide their age at first experience of anxiety or depression.\n\n    The second-largest group is individuals aged 20â€“29, representing 22.2% of the distribution.

The prevalence of eating disorders is significantly higher in females than in males, which aligns with the general understanding of these conditions.\n\n2. The variability in prevalence rates among females is greater, indicating that eating disorders in females may be more influenced by a variety of factors, possibly including cultural aspects, societal pressures, or biological predispositions.\n\n3. The global average prevalence of eating disorders over time for males, females, and all genders combined is growing up.\n\n#### Mental Health Dataset\n\n1.

The largest segment of the chart, making up 34.9%, is unspecified and labeled \"Don't know/Refused,\" indicating a significant portion of respondents either did not know or refused to provide their age at first experience of anxiety or depression.\n\n    The second-largest group is individuals aged 20â€“29, representing 22.2% of the distribution. This suggests that early adulthood is a common time for individuals to experience their first instance of these mental health issues.\n\n    Those aged 30â€“39 make up 12.5% of the distribution, while individuals aged 40 and over account for 11.4%.\n\n    Adolescents aged 13â€“19 represent 11.5% of the distribution, indicating that the onset of anxiety or depression can also begin during teenage years.\n\n    The smallest identified age group is children under the age of 13, at 7.5%, which highlights that while less common, young children can also experience these mental health issues.\n\n    Overall, the data suggests that the onset of anxiety or depression is reported most frequently during the ages of 20â€“29 and that there's a notable amount of uncertainty or unwillingness to provide information regarding the age of first experience with these conditions.\n\n2. High Uncertainty or Non-disclosure: 'Don't know/Refused' responses are notably high across all entities, with Africa recording the highest at 42.7% ,lower-middle income countries at 40.6% and Europe the lowest at 14.5%. This indicates a significant amount of data is either not known or not disclosed.\n\n    High-Income Countries: except for 'Don't know/Refused', The highest ratios are observed in the 'Ages 13_19'and lowest in the Age < 13\n\n    Upper-middle income countries: except for 'Don't know/Refused', The ratios are more balanced across the age categories, with the lowest ratio STILL in age <13.\n\n    lower-middle income countries: except for 'Don't know/Refused',The highest ratios are observed in the 'Ages 20_29' and it is almost 3 times higher than other age categories.\n\n    Europe: The ratios are more balanced across the age categories, with the lowest ratio in age <13.\n\n    Africa and Asia: The ratios are Highest in the 'Ages 20_29' and lowest in the Age < 13, but the ratio in Asia is higher than Africa.\n\n##### Eating disorder Dataset\n\n1. The prevalence of eating disorders is significantly higher in females than in males, which aligns with the general understanding of these conditions.\n\n2. The variability in prevalence rates among females is greater, indicating that eating disorders in females may be more influenced by a variety of factors, possibly including cultural aspects, societal pressures, or biological predispositions.\n\n3. The global average prevalence of eating disorders over time for males, females, and all genders combined is growing up.\n\n#### Mental Health Dataset\n\n1. Educational factors, indicated by 'average_learning_Adjusted_of_school', show the most consistent strong positive correlations across several mental health outcomes, suggesting that education level may be a strong predictor of mental health outcomes, potentially due to greater awareness and reporting.\n\n2. Socioeconomic factors, particularly income level, also show strong correlations, especially in high-income groups. \n\n3. Geographic factors show both strong negative and moderate positive correlations, indicating a more complex relationship with mental health outcomes that could be influenced by a variety of regional factors.\n\n\n## Tools and Software\n\n- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.\n- Matplotlib: For creating the bar chart visualization.\n- Seaborn: Although not used in the last plot, it is an excellent tool for creating heatmaps and other complex visualizations.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"Exploration.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
