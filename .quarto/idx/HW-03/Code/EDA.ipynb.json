The correlation matrix typically requires numerical variables. To include these categorical variables, we would need to convert them into a numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding.\n\nThe updated heatmap now includes the one-hot encoded categorical variables 'Income group' and 'Continent'. Due to the number of categories, the annotations were turned off to keep the heatmap readable. Each square still represents the correlation between two variables, with warmer colors indicating a stronger positive correlation and cooler colors a stronger negative correlation.\n\n\nTime Series Plot\n\nGlobal trend of 'Depression (%)' over time.\n\nThe Time Series Plot above shows the global trend of depression over time, depicting the average percentage of depression prevalence across all economies for each year.\n\n\n\n #### Data Grouping and Segmentation\n Bar Chart\n \n compare the prevalence of 'Anxiety disorders (%)' and 'Eating disorders (%)' in the most recent year available across the top 10 economies by GDP. To do this, we first need to identify the top 10 economies by GDP and then gather the data for the specified disorders. \n\nThe Bar Chart displays the prevalence of anxiety and eating disorders in the most recent year available across the top 10 economies as measured by GDP. Each economy is represented by a bar, with separate segments for anxiety disorders and eating disorders, allowing for a direct comparison between these conditions within each economy.\n\nwe can draw the conclusion that the Eating disorders and Anxiety disorders, Bipolar disorder (%) are not related to GDP\n\n\nThe Box Plot\n\nBox Plot: Distribution of 'Bipolar disorder (%)' prevalence rates across different income groups\n\nThe Box Plot above shows the distribution of bipolar disorder prevalence rates across different income groups for the most recent year available. The plot provides insights into the median prevalence rates, the interquartile ranges, and any potential outliers within each income group category.\n\nWe can draw the conclusion that the Bipolar Disorder is realted to Income group.\n\n\n\nScatter Plot:\n\nExamine the relationship between GDP and the prevalence of depression for the most recent year across all economies.​\n\nwe can draw the conclusion that Depression Prevalence (%) are not related to GDP\n\nThe scatter plot\n\nSchizophrenia: There appears to be a cluster of points towards the lower end of the educational scale with varying prevalence rates. As education levels increase, the prevalence rates seem to spread out, indicating a less clear relationship.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The data points are dispersed across the educational spectrum with no clear trend indicating a strong relationship between education and the prevalence of bipolar disorder.\n\nEating Disorders: This plot shows a somewhat more dispersed distribution, suggesting that higher education levels might not necessarily correlate with higher or lower prevalence rates of eating disorders.\n\nAnxiety Disorders: There's a wide spread of prevalence rates at all levels of education, suggesting that the relationship between education and anxiety disorders may be influenced by factors other than education alone.\n\nDepression (%):  There's a wide spread of prevalence rates at all levels of education, suggesting that the relationship between education and Depression disorders may be influenced by factors other than education alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Eating disorder Dataset\nTime Series Line Plot: Showing the trend of eating disorder prevalence over years for a specific country or averaged globally.\n\nBar Chart: Comparing the prevalence of eating disorders between males and females across different countries.\n\nBox Plot: Displaying the distribution of eating disorder prevalence for all countries across different years to see the variability and outliers.\n\nHeatmap: Visualizing the prevalence of eating disorders across countries and years in a color-coded format.\n\nScatter Plot: Comparing the male vs. female prevalence of eating disorders to see the correlation between genders.\n\nThe line plot above shows the global average prevalence of eating disorders over time for males, females, and all genders combined. The trends can be compared to see how the prevalence has changed over the years.\n\nBar chart\ncompare the prevalence of eating disorders between males and females across different countries. For clarity, we will take a subset of countries to avoid cluttering the chart. \n\nThe bar chart above compares the prevalence of eating disorders between males (in light blue) and females (in pink) for a randomly selected subset of 10 countries in the latest year available in the dataset.\n\nData Grouping and Segmentation\nFor the third visualization, We can group the data by country and by year to analyze trends over time and segment by gender to compare the prevalence rates.\n\nIdentifying Outliers\nWe will look for countries with prevalence rates that are significantly higher or lower than the global average for each year and by gender.\n\nMale Eating Disorder Prevalence Rate:\n\nThe median prevalence rate is approximately 0.11%.\nThe range of prevalence rates is quite broad, with the lowest around 0.03% and the highest at about 0.67%.\nThe interquartile range (middle 50% of the data) spans from approximately 0.08% to 0.16%, indicating that half of the reported rates fall within this range.\n\nFemale Eating Disorder Prevalence Rate:\n\nThe median prevalence rate is approximately 0.21%, which is notably higher than that of males.\nThe prevalence rates for females also show a broad range, from about 0.06% to 1.40%.\nThe interquartile range for females is wider than for males, ranging from about 0.14% to 0.40%, reflecting greater variability in the rates reported for females.\n\nOutlier Identification:\n\nFor males, any country with a prevalence rate significantly higher than 0.16% could be considered an outlier.\nFor females, countries with rates above 0.40% would be outliers, with the maximum reported rate being quite extreme at 1.40%.\n\nheatmap\n\nThe heatmap above visualizes the prevalence of eating disorders across different years in China. Each cell in the heatmap corresponds to a specific year and shows the prevalence rate, with the color intensity reflecting the magnitude of that rate.​\n\ncreate a scatter plot to compare the male vs. female prevalence of eating disorders to see the correlation between genders. We'll use data from the most recent year for all countries to see the relationship.​\n\nThe scatter plot above compares the prevalence of eating disorders between males (on the x-axis) and females (on the y-axis) for the most recent year available in the dataset. Each point represents a country, and the gray dashed line indicates where the prevalence would be equal for both genders. Points above the line show countries where the prevalence is higher in females compared to males, which seems to be the case for all countries shown.\n\n\n### Age First Depression or Anxiety Data\n\nCreate a pie chart showing the distribution of age categories for the onset of anxiety or depression for the \"World\" entity,\nI'll first filter the dataset for the 'World' entity, and then plot the data.\n\nSince the data does not seem to have a time component or an inherent sequence, we'll skip the line chart and instead create a heatmap to visualize the relationship between entities and age groups.\n\n\nThe heatmap above visualizes the percentages by entity and age category for the first experience of anxiety or depression. The color intensity represents the magnitude of the percentages, with cooler colors indicating lower percentages and warmer colors indicating higher percentages.\n\nFinally create a stacked bar chart to represent the cumulative percentages of age categories for each entity.\n\ngrouping the data by Entity and visualizing the distribution of the Percentage across different Age brackets. This will help us understand if there are significant differences in the age of onset for anxiety or depression across different parts of the world and different income levels.​\n\n\nThe bar chart and table display the distribution of the age of onset for anxiety or depression across various entities, which include continents, income categories, and the world overall. From the visualization and the data, we can observe the following:\n\nVariability in Age of Onset: There is considerable variability in the age of onset for anxiety or depression among different entities. For example, in Europe, a higher percentage reports the onset during the age brackets of \"Ages 20-29\" and \"Ages ≥40\", whereas in Africa, the onset is more reported in the younger age bracket \"Ages 13-19\" and \"Ages 20-29\".\n\nHigh-Income Countries: In high-income countries, the age bracket \"Ages 13-19\" has the highest reported onset, followed by \"Ages ≥40\" and \"Ages 20-29\".\n\nLower-Middle-Income Countries: Here, the age bracket \"Ages 20-29\" has the highest reported onset, suggesting that the onset of anxiety or depression may occur later compared to high-income countries.\n\nDon't Know/Refused: A significant portion of respondents across all entities did not provide a specific age bracket or refused to answer, with Africa having the highest percentage in this category. This could reflect cultural differences in discussing mental health or data collection challenges.\n\n### GDP_mental_health_2017_Dataset\n\nHistograms for mental health indicators to see their distribution across the dataset.\n\nThe histograms provide a distribution of each mental health indicator across the countries in the dataset for the year 2017\n\n\n\nscatter plots\n\nvisualize the potential correlation between GDP per capita and each mental health indicator.\n\n\nThe scatter plots have been generated, showing the relationship between GDP per capita and each mental health indicator.\n\nSchizophrenia (%) vs GDP per Capita: There does not appear to be a clear trend indicating that the prevalence of schizophrenia is related to GDP per capita. The distribution of points seems scattered without a distinct pattern.\n\nBipolar Disorder (%) vs GDP per Capita: Similar to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder prevalence does not show a clear correlation with GDP per capita based on the scatter plot.\n\nEating Disorders (%) vs GDP per Capita: For eating disorders, there might be a slight positive trend, suggesting that higher GDP per capita could be associated with a higher reported prevalence of eating disorders. This could be due to better reporting and diagnosis in higher-income countries, but further statistical analysis would be needed to confirm any correlation.\n\nAnxiety Disorders (%) vs GDP per Capita: The scatter plot does not reveal a strong correlation between the prevalence of anxiety disorders and GDP per capita. However, there is some spread in the data that might warrant a closer look with more sophisticated statistical tools.\n\nGeneral Observations: The prevalence rates for the mental health conditions do not show strong visual evidence of a correlation with GDP per capita. This might suggest that mental health issues are widespread and not necessarily directly related to the economic status of a country.\n\nIt is important to note that these are preliminary insights based solely on visual analysis. To draw more concrete conclusions, you would need to perform a quantitative analysis, such as calculating the correlation coefficients or conducting regression analysis. Additionally, it's important to consider other factors that could influence mental health statistics, such as healthcare access, cultural attitudes towards mental health, and the quality of data reporting in different countries.\n\n\nHeatmap of the correlation matrix to understand how different indicators are related to each other. This will include GDP per capita and the mental health indicators.​\n\nThe heatmap displays the correlation coefficients between the GDP per capita and mental health indicators. Values close to 1 or -1 indicate a strong positive or negative correlation, respectively, while values close to 0 indicate a weak or no correlation.\n\n\n## Hypothesis Generation \n\n\n#### Age First Depression or Anxiety Data\n\n1. The cultural, economic, and social environments in high-income countries might contribute to an earlier age of onset for anxiety or depression.\n\n2. In regions with lower-middle-income levels, the onset of anxiety or depression might occur later, potentially due to different life stressors or lower levels of mental health awareness and reporting.\n\n#### Eating disorder Dataset\n\n1. The prevalence of eating disorders is higher in countries with higher GDP per capita, which could reflect better diagnostic capabilities or different societal pressures.\n\n2. There may be significant differences in the prevalence of eating disorders between genders across different countries, potentially reflecting cultural, social, or biological factors.\n\n#### GDP_mental_health_2017_Dataset\n\n1. Higher GDP per capita might be associated with higher reported rates of mental health disorders, potentially due to better health services and reporting mechanisms.\n\n2. The prevalence of different mental health disorders will vary across economies, possibly due to genetic, environmental, cultural, or socioeconomic factors.\n\n#### Mental Health Dataset\n\n1. Educational outcomes may be associated with the prevalence or reporting of certain mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia and eating disorders.\n\n2. The lack of correlation between GDP and comfort in discussing mental health could imply that economic development does not directly influence cultural attitudes toward mental health openness.\n\n3.The correlations between different mental health conditions suggest the possibility of common underlying risk factors or increased comorbidity.\n\n\n\n## Identiy Outliers\n\n##### Age First Depression or Anxiety Data\n\nThe data does not have individual country-level entries, so it's not possible to identify outliers in the traditional sense. However, the \"Don't Know/Refused\" category stands out and could be considered an anomaly in the reporting of mental health data.\n\n##### Eating disorder Dataset\n\nWe will look for countries with prevalence rates that are significantly higher or lower than the global average for each year and by gender.\n\n\n\n\nFor males, any country with a prevalence rate significantly higher than 0.16% could be considered an outlier.\nFor females, countries with rates above 0.40% would be outliers, with the maximum reported rate being quite extreme at 1.40%.\n\n##### GDP_mental_health_2017_Dataset\n##### Mental Health Dataset\n\n## Report and discuss methods and findings\n\n##### Age First Depression or Anxiety Data\n\nThe bar chart and table display the distribution of the age of onset for anxiety or depression across various entities, which include continents, income categories, and the world overall. From the visualization and the data, we can observe the following:\n\nVariability in Age of Onset: There is considerable variability in the age of onset for anxiety or depression among different entities. For example, in Europe, a higher percentage reports the onset during the age brackets of \"Ages 20-29\" and \"Ages ≥40\", whereas in Africa, the onset is more reported in the younger age bracket \"Ages 13-19\" and \"Ages 20-29\".\n\nHigh-Income Countries: In high-income countries, the age bracket \"Ages 13-19\" has the highest reported onset, followed by \"Ages ≥40\" and \"Ages 20-29\".\n\nLower-Middle-Income Countries: Here, the age bracket \"Ages 20-29\" has the highest reported onset, suggesting that the onset of anxiety or depression may occur later compared to high-income countries.\n\nDon't Know/Refused: A significant portion of respondents across all entities did not provide a specific age bracket or refused to answer, with Africa having the highest percentage in this category. This could reflect cultural differences in discussing mental health or data collection challenges.\n\n##### Eating disorder Dataset\n\nThe prevalence of eating disorders is significantly higher in females than in males, which aligns with the general understanding of these conditions.\n\nThe variability in prevalence rates among females is greater, indicating that eating disorders in females may be more influenced by a variety of factors, possibly including cultural aspects, societal pressures, or biological predispositions.\n\nThe global average prevalence of eating disorders over time for males, females, and all genders combined is growing up.\n\n##### GDP_mental_health_2017_Dataset\n\nEating Disorders (%) vs GDP per Capita: For eating disorders, there might be a slight positive trend, suggesting that higher GDP per capita could be associated with a higher reported prevalence of eating disorders.\n\n#### Mental Health Dataset\nwe can draw the conclusion that the Eating disorders and Anxiety disorders, Bipolar disorder (%) are not related to GDP.\n\nSchizophrenia: There appears to be a cluster of points towards the lower end of the educational scale with varying prevalence rates. As education levels increase, the prevalence rates seem to spread out, indicating a less clear relationship.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The data points are dispersed across the educational spectrum with no clear trend indicating a strong relationship between education and the prevalence of bipolar disorder.\n\nEating Disorders: This plot shows a somewhat more dispersed distribution, suggesting that higher education levels might not necessarily correlate with higher or lower prevalence rates of eating disorders.\n\nAnxiety Disorders: There's a wide spread of prevalence rates at all levels of education, suggesting that the relationship between education and anxiety disorders may be influenced by factors other than education alone.\n\nDepression (%):  There's a wide spread of prevalence rates at all levels of education, suggesting that the relationship between education and Depression disorders may be influenced by factors other than education alone.\n\n\n\n## Tools and Software\n\n- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.\n- Matplotlib: For creating the bar chart visualization.\n- Seaborn: Although not used in the last plot, it is an excellent tool for creating heatmaps and other complex visualizations.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

For example, in Europe, a higher percentage reports the onset during the age brackets of \"Ages 20-29\" and \"Ages ≥40\", whereas in Africa, the onset is more reported in the younger age bracket \"Ages 13-19\" and \"Ages 20-29\".\n\nHigh-Income Countries: In high-income countries, the age bracket \"Ages 13-19\" has the highest reported onset, followed by \"Ages ≥40\" and \"Ages 20-29\".\n\nLower-Middle-Income Countries: Here, the age bracket \"Ages 20-29\" has the highest reported onset, suggesting that the onset of anxiety or depression may occur later compared to high-income countries.\n\nDon't Know/Refused: A significant portion of respondents across all entities did not provide a specific age bracket or refused to answer, with Africa having the highest percentage in this category. This could reflect cultural differences in discussing mental health or data collection challenges.\n\n### GDP_mental_health_2017_Dataset\n\nHistograms for mental health indicators to see their distribution across the dataset.\n\nThe histograms provide a distribution of each mental health indicator across the countries in the dataset for the year 2017\n\n\n\nscatter plots\n\nvisualize the potential correlation between GDP per capita and each mental health indicator.\n\n\nThe scatter plots have been generated, showing the relationship between GDP per capita and each mental health indicator.\n\nSchizophrenia (%) vs GDP per Capita: There does not appear to be a clear trend indicating that the prevalence of schizophrenia is related to GDP per capita. The distribution of points seems scattered without a distinct pattern.\n\nBipolar Disorder (%) vs GDP per Capita: Similar to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder prevalence does not show a clear correlation with GDP per capita based on the scatter plot.\n\nEating Disorders (%) vs GDP per Capita: For eating disorders, there might be a slight positive trend, suggesting that higher GDP per capita could be associated with a higher reported prevalence of eating disorders. This could be due to better reporting and diagnosis in higher-income countries, but further statistical analysis would be needed to confirm any correlation.\n\nAnxiety Disorders (%) vs GDP per Capita: The scatter plot does not reveal a strong correlation between the prevalence of anxiety disorders and GDP per capita. However, there is some spread in the data that might warrant a closer look with more sophisticated statistical tools.\n\nGeneral Observations: The prevalence rates for the mental health conditions do not show strong visual evidence of a correlation with GDP per capita. This might suggest that mental health issues are widespread and not necessarily directly related to the economic status of a country.\n\nIt is important to note that these are preliminary insights based solely on visual analysis. To draw more concrete conclusions, you would need to perform a quantitative analysis, such as calculating the correlation coefficients or conducting regression analysis. Additionally, it's important to consider other factors that could influence mental health statistics, such as healthcare access, cultural attitudes towards mental health, and the quality of data reporting in different countries.\n\n\nHeatmap of the correlation matrix to understand how different indicators are related to each other. This will include GDP per capita and the mental health indicators.​\n\nThe heatmap displays the correlation coefficients between the GDP per capita and mental health indicators. Values close to 1 or -1 indicate a strong positive or negative correlation, respectively, while values close to 0 indicate a weak or no correlation.\n\n\n## Hypothesis Generation \n\n\n#### Age First Depression or Anxiety Data\n\n1. The cultural, economic, and social environments in high-income countries might contribute to an earlier age of onset for anxiety or depression.\n\n2. In regions with lower-middle-income levels, the onset of anxiety or depression might occur later, potentially due to different life stressors or lower levels of mental health awareness and reporting.\n\n#### Eating disorder Dataset\n\n1. The prevalence of eating disorders is higher in countries with higher GDP per capita, which could reflect better diagnostic capabilities or different societal pressures.\n\n2. There may be significant differences in the prevalence of eating disorders between genders across different countries, potentially reflecting cultural, social, or biological factors.\n\n#### GDP_mental_health_2017_Dataset\n\n1. Higher GDP per capita might be associated with higher reported rates of mental health disorders, potentially due to better health services and reporting mechanisms.\n\n2. The prevalence of different mental health disorders will vary across economies, possibly due to genetic, environmental, cultural, or socioeconomic factors.\n\n#### Mental Health Dataset\n\n1. Educational outcomes may be associated with the prevalence or reporting of certain mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia and eating disorders.\n\n2. The lack of correlation between GDP and comfort in discussing mental health could imply that economic development does not directly influence cultural attitudes toward mental health openness.\n\n3.The correlations between different mental health conditions suggest the possibility of common underlying risk factors or increased comorbidity.\n\n\n\n## Identiy Outliers\n\n##### Age First Depression or Anxiety Data\n\nThe data does not have individual country-level entries, so it's not possible to identify outliers in the traditional sense. However, the \"Don't Know/Refused\" category stands out and could be considered an anomaly in the reporting of mental health data.\n\n##### Eating disorder Dataset\n\nWe will look for countries with prevalence rates that are significantly higher or lower than the global average for each year and by gender.\n\n\n\n\nFor males, any country with a prevalence rate significantly higher than 0.16% could be considered an outlier.\nFor females, countries with rates above 0.40% would be outliers, with the maximum reported rate being quite extreme at 1.40%.\n\n##### GDP_mental_health_2017_Dataset\n##### Mental Health Dataset\n\n## Report and discuss methods and findings\n\n##### Age First Depression or Anxiety Data\n\nThe bar chart and table display the distribution of the age of onset for anxiety or depression across various entities, which include continents, income categories, and the world overall. From the visualization and the data, we can observe the following:\n\nVariability in Age of Onset: There is considerable variability in the age of onset for anxiety or depression among different entities. For example, in Europe, a higher percentage reports the onset during the age brackets of \"Ages 20-29\" and \"Ages ≥40\", whereas in Africa, the onset is more reported in the younger age bracket \"Ages 13-19\" and \"Ages 20-29\".\n\nHigh-Income Countries: In high-income countries, the age bracket \"Ages 13-19\" has the highest reported onset, followed by \"Ages ≥40\" and \"Ages 20-29\".\n\nLower-Middle-Income Countries: Here, the age bracket \"Ages 20-29\" has the highest reported onset, suggesting that the onset of anxiety or depression may occur later compared to high-income countries.\n\nDon't Know/Refused: A significant portion of respondents across all entities did not provide a specific age bracket or refused to answer, with Africa having the highest percentage in this category. This could reflect cultural differences in discussing mental health or data collection challenges.\n\n##### Eating disorder Dataset\n\nThe prevalence of eating disorders is significantly higher in females than in males, which aligns with the general understanding of these conditions.\n\nThe variability in prevalence rates among females is greater, indicating that eating disorders in females may be more influenced by a variety of factors, possibly including cultural aspects, societal pressures, or biological predispositions.\n\nThe global average prevalence of eating disorders over time for males, females, and all genders combined is growing up.\n\n##### GDP_mental_health_2017_Dataset\n\nEating Disorders (%) vs GDP per Capita: For eating disorders, there might be a slight positive trend, suggesting that higher GDP per capita could be associated with a higher reported prevalence of eating disorders.\n\n#### Mental Health Dataset\nwe can draw the conclusion that the Eating disorders and Anxiety disorders, Bipolar disorder (%) are not related to GDP.\n\nSchizophrenia: There appears to be a cluster of points towards the lower end of the educational scale with varying prevalence rates. As education levels increase, the prevalence rates seem to spread out, indicating a less clear relationship.\n\nBipolar Disorder: The data points are dispersed across the educational spectrum with no clear trend indicating a strong relationship between education and the prevalence of bipolar disorder.\n\nEating Disorders: This plot shows a somewhat more dispersed distribution, suggesting that higher education levels might not necessarily correlate with higher or lower prevalence rates of eating disorders.\n\nAnxiety Disorders: There's a wide spread of prevalence rates at all levels of education, suggesting that the relationship between education and anxiety disorders may be influenced by factors other than education alone.\n\nDepression (%):  There's a wide spread of prevalence rates at all levels of education, suggesting that the relationship between education and Depression disorders may be influenced by factors other than education alone.\n\n\n\n## Tools and Software\n\n- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.\n- Matplotlib: For creating the bar chart visualization.\n- Seaborn: Although not used in the last plot, it is an excellent tool for creating heatmaps and other complex visualizations.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"EDA.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
