abstract = {Background
Telehealth strategies for asthma have focused primarily on adherence to controller medications. Telemonitoring of short-acting β-agonist (SABA) focuses on patterns of use and may allow more timely action to avert exacerbations. Studies assessing this approach are lacking.
Objective
This pragmatic controlled study was designed to measure real-world effectiveness of the Propeller Health Asthma Platform to reduce use of SABA and improve asthma control.
Methods
A total of 495 patients were enrolled in parallel arms (1:1) for 12 months of monitoring SABA use. Intervention group (IG) patients received access to and feedback from the Propeller Health system. Routine care (RC) patients were outfitted with sensors but did not receive feedback. Physicians were able to monitor the status of their patients in the IG and receive proactive notifications.
Results
The daily mean number of SABA uses per person decreased by 0.41 for the IG and by 0.31 for RC between the first week and the remainder of the study period (P < .001 for the difference between groups). Similarly, the proportion of SABA-free days increased 21% for the IG and 17% for RC (P < .01 for the difference between groups). Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores were not significantly different between arms in the entire study population, but adults with initially uncontrolled ACT scores showed a significantly larger improvement in the proportion with controlled asthma in IG versus RC (63% controlled in the study period vs 49%, respectively; P < .05 comparing the 2 improvements).
Conclusions
Compared with RC, the study arm monitoring SABA use with the Propeller Health system significantly decreased SABA use, increased SABA-free days, and improved ACT scores (the latter among adults initially lacking asthma control).}

abstract = {Primary care physicians (PCPs) provide the majority of medical care to patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD. However, PCPs report numerous limitations to providing expert CKD care, including poor patient education, inadequate diagnostic evaluation, suboptimal use of medications, and time limitations. The Kidney Coordinated HeAlth Management Partnership (Kidney CHAMP) trial is a cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel centralized electronic health records (EHR)-delivered population health management (PHM) strategy for high-risk CKD patients on patient care, safety, and other outcomes of interest to patients, providers, and payors. Over a 42-month period, the trial will compare the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention that combines early identification of high-risk patients, timely nephrology guidance, pharmacist-led medication management services, and CKD patient education to usual care and enroll 1650 high-risk CKD patients from 100 primary care practices. The primary outcome will be ≥40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) or end stage kidney disease. Key secondary outcomes will include blood pressure, renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors use, and exposure to potentially unsafe medications. If successful, our treatment approach could improve CKD care delivery and safety, resource allocation, and adoption of evidence-based CKD guideline-concordant care.}
